# BHMultikey
Multi-keyboard support for Brawlhalla

This program allows using multiple keyboards on one computer in Brawlhalla.

## Instructions
This program depends on the Visual C++ runtime. You'll need to download it from [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145). Make sure to download the same version (32 or 64 bit) as the program.  
To use, replace BrawlhallaAir.swf and Game.swz from the Brawlhalla directory with the ones in the archive. BHMultikey.exe must be running to actually enable multi-keyboard functionality. Make sure to launch BHMultikey.exe before leaving the main menu.

## Extras
- `;` toggles jumping with the up key (default is off)
- `\` can be used to rebind controls. Press `\`, then press the desired controls in this order:
  - up, left, down, right, jump, throw, light, heavy, dodge
- Press `\` again to disable remapped controls.
## Caveats
- Tooltips will show controller button names instead of keys
- In-game chat will not work, and things typed into steam chat will also be interpret as inputs
- The whole program is a bit hacked together, so crashes may happen. Error reporting is disabled because any issues that occur are much more likely my fault than BMG's
